# Notes from “[Zara Taught Zudio How to Outdo Zara](https://the-ken.com/story/zara-taught-zudio-how-to-outdo-zara/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=con_1_unit_4)”

## Zara’s Entry into India via Tata Trent
Zara entered India by partnering with Tata Trent, but years later the partnership seems to have benefited Tata more than Zara:
- Zara’s contribution to Trent’s sales has slashed to half of 28 % from 2018.
- Zara now has stories in the lower double digits.
- Failing unit economics have led to shutting down stores in key markets such as Mumbai.

## Lessons Tata Learned from Zara

### 1. Friday Drop Model & RFID Tech  
Trent copied Zara’s Friday-drop inventory model and implemented RFID technology in its Zudio and Westside chains to predict which items will resonate most with customers.

### 2. Premium Store Experience for Zudio  
- Leveraged Zara’s store look and feel for Zudio, offering a premium, luxury ambience at a fraction of Zara’s price.  
- Zudio moves merchandise at remarkable pace—selling around 90 T‑shirts every second and 20 pairs of denim every hour.

### 3. FOMO Effect Among Young Shoppers  
Creates a “fear of missing out” for the 18–24 age group: if you don’t buy it now, it will be gone.

### 4. Rapid Store Expansion & Revenue Contribution  
- Zudio’s store count is increasing exponentially compared to Zara’s.  
- Zudio now contributes more to Trent’s revenues than Zara.

## Comparative Lead Times
- **Tata Trent:** 90–120 days from shopfloor to store.  
- **Zara:** 7–10 days from shopfloor to store.

## Sourcing Strategies
- **Zara:** Relies on state‑of‑the‑art machinery in China and cheap labor in Bangladesh and Vietnam.  
- **Zudio:** Uses third‑party Indian vendors and sources raw materials in bulk a year or two in advance.

## Future Outlook under Flexible FDI Norms
With India’s more flexible single‑brand FDI norms, Zara can learn from its competitors even faster and build its own standalone presence—rather than depending on Tata—for future growth.
